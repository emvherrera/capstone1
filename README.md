This README file include project requirements that include describing the project, provding application screen images, and showcasing an interesting piece of code with an explanation.
## Project Description

The Ledger application is a command-line tool designed to help users track their financial transactions, specifically deposits and payments.
It provides an interface for adding new transactions, viewing a detailed ledger, and generating various financial reports. 
The application uses transaction data through a CSV file, ensuring that information is saved between sessions.

One interesting piece of code in this project is the `Visit` class and its `display()` method. This method demonstrates how to format the `LocalDateTime` object into a user-friendly string for display on the console.

Interesting piece of code

//Im proud of structuring git staging and commitments consistently with minor errors. This is something I struggled understanding a few weeks ago//

â€¢	Error Handling- Learning to anticipate and handle potential problems (like file errors) is a crucial but a confusing aspect of programming. I use gemini to help explain and revise any errors after exhausting attempts at resolving in debugger without success.
